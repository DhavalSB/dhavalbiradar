  <p>As the semester came to an end this year, I knew I wanted to cook more. The previous months had been busy and the summer would finally offer an outlet to all my vaulted projects.
Then came an idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How can I use this time to <em>actually</em> improve my cooking skills&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cooking is primarily a fun hobby for me, so over the years making simple recipes has come to feel mundane and repetitive.
But despite having made many of the intricate foods I’ve wanted to, from <a href="/images/1.jpeg">croissants</a> to hand pulled noodles, 
I’ve never been able to truly unlock kitchen freedom. While I consider my technique and intuition relatively developed, I’m definitely not skilled
enough to <em>just make something interesting</em>. So I made a plan—my “Grand Scheme”—to apply to my cooking this summer, with a few goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rely less on recipes</li>
</ol>
<p>Recipes should be an invitation to something new—flavors, cuisines, ingredients, techniques, etc.
However, I tend to use them as a rulebook, which has me buried in the
measurements more than I would like.</p>
<p>For a long time now, I've been inspired by
a framework-based approach rather than a recipe approach to cooking, strongly because of work
by <a href="https://www.cookwell.com">Ethan Chlebowski</a> and J. Kenji Lopez Alt.
I've implemented many skills from these two, but now I want to thoroughly
embrace the process of being my own recipe-creator.</p>
<p>To get to a high level of comfort with a dish requires lots of
research and often just trial and error. Luckily, we have the internet! So goal 1's solution is thorough
research from good sources<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. By understanding what ties together many different
variations of a dish, we can better understand what is fundamental and
what is up for interpretation. Then, we can string together our own interpretation without
need for precision (A.K.A. freedom). This is why I aim to 
understand important <strong>ratios</strong>, and why I always prefer to measure by weight.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Improvisation</li>
</ol>
<p>Improvisation in the kitchen means being able to respond to unideal scenarios.
This is important when not knowing what to do with available ingredients, not having
the correct ingredients for a dish, or even reacting to a mistake.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>A few I trust are Ethan Chlebowski, Kenji (and Serious
Eats), Joshua Weissman, Babish, Claire Saffitz, and often ChatGPT as well (with
thorough questioning). </p>
