One of my favorite types of flight is a bay tour, a flight over San Francisco. Here's some of the best photos I have from past bay tours.

One of the coolest parts of flying GA (general aviation) planes is these views. Usually, commercial flights are too high to see the buildings up close. The city
looks like a model in a museum from above.

On the flying side, a bay tour takes more planning, and can even get denied in some instances if San Francisco is too busy. Recently, I've been flying along the East Bay over the Bay Bridge, which I find is less risky than flying into the KSFO Bravo airspace.

I think the bridge looks better in the day to be honest, but the city is really cool at night.
