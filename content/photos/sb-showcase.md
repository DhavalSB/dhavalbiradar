Flying to Santa Barbara Airport (KSBA) had been one of my dreams for a long time before earning my pilot's license.
After multiple cancellations due to weather, and a lot of anticipation, the skies finally cleared for the journey in late July.

I was excited to try Kin Bakeshop, one of the best reviewed cafes I'd seen…

Kin did not disappoint. The sando was definitely the highlight with the freshness of the mango,
and the drinks, as well as other pastries were all super well made. Even the complementary barley tea they served was outstanding. I've yet to find a better cafe than Kin, and hopefully they stick around.

KSBA is littered with private and business jets, and it was pretty fun to see the bougie vibes at the FBO.

Leaving KSBA, the views were great. We chose a higher cruising altitude of 8,500 ft mostly for fun, but it also helped make the journey more relaxed with the added terrain clearance.
