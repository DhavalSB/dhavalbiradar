Hello there! I'm Dhaval, a senior in high school. In my free time I fly planes, cook, bake, make coffee, play guitar, and climb rocks. I'm interested
in pursuing math or computer science in the future.

This summer I'm pushing myself to do some projects to deepen my interests. This
site shall be the hub for my yap about everything I'm up to.
